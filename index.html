     <h1> Tortoise, turtle and sea turtle. What's the difference?</h1> </header>
     <main>
      <p>
      Surprise, they’re ALL turtles! “Turtle” refers to all species in that group – including tortoises and sea turtles. Typically, tortoises live entirely on land, while sea turtles live entirely in the water – they only come on land to lay eggs. Turtles spend time in the water and on land. 
     </p>
     <p>
      Turtles are very adaptive and can be found on every continent, except Antarctica. Most turtle species are found in southeastern North America and South Asia and only five species live in Europe. Turtles are not social creatures. While they typically don’t mind if there are other turtles around them, they don’t interact or socialize. Most turtles are active during the day, spending their time foraging for food.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sadly, many species of turtle are endangered! 129 of approximately 300 species of turtle and tortoise on Earth today are either vulnerable, endangered, or critically endangered, according to the IUCN. Threats include loss of habitat, poaching and the illegal pet trade. On the island of Madagascar, locked gates, razor-wire fences, and 24-hour armed guards protect one of the world’s rarest treasures. That treasure, worth roughly $50,000 each on the black market, is the last wild population of the critically endangered ploughshare tortoise, the rarest tortoise on the planet.

       <h2>Tortoise</h2>
       <div class="center">

       <ul>
       <li>Tortoises are land animals</li> 
       <li>Their feet are round and stumpy, adapted for walking on land, also dig burrows with their strong forelimbs, and slip underground when the sun gets too hot</li> 
       <li>The turtle class, of which tortoises are a family, dates back to the late Triassic period. This age coincides with the first dinosaurs, and unlike other evolved species, the land turtle has not changed much from that time period. One difference in the modern tortoise from its ancestor is that Triassic turtles originally had teeth, while the modern tortoise has a beak</li>
       </ul>
         <h2>Land turtles</h2>
         <div class="center">
         <img src="suxoputnaya-cherepaxa.png" alt="Land turteles" width="400" height="200">
         </div>
         <ul>
         <li>Land turtles are shelled reptiles that live on land as opposed to their aquatic counterparts</li>
         <li>Land turtles can thrive in a variety of different climates, including tropical forests and blistering hot desert sand</li>
         <li>Turtles are easily recognised by their bony, cartilaginous shell. This super-tough casing acts like a shield to protect them from predators – some turtles can even tuck their head up inside their shell for extra protection!</li> 
         <li>Just like your bones, a turtle’s shell is actually part of its skeleton. It’s made up of over 50 bones which include the turtle’s rib cage and spine</li>
         </ul>
           <h2>Sea turtles</h2>
           <div class="center">
           <img src="unnamed.png" alt="Sea turteles" width="400" height="200">
          </div>
           <ul>
           <li>Sea turtles are large, air-breathing reptiles that inhabit tropical and subtropical seas throughout the world</li>
           <li>A sea turtle’s teardrop-shaped body also makes it easier to glide and dive. It’s awesome for swimming, but has a limitation: sea turtles can’t tuck their heads and limbs into their shells for protection. When a predator is near, sea turtles instead swim sideways to make themselves look bigger – too big to swallow!</li>
           <li>Sea turtles feed on jellyfish and keep their populations in check. Plastic looks like jellyfish when it's floating in the water and that's why so many turtles die from ingesting plastic—they were going for a tasty snack</li>
           </ul>
             <h2>Funny facts</h2>
             <ol>
             <li>Turtles aren’t silent. Although they’re not likely to be as loud as dogs or cats, turtles do make a range of noises, anything from chicken-like clucks to dog-like barking, depending on the species</li>
             <li>Turtles have a second shell. Besides their outer shell, turtles also have a lower shell, called a plastron</li>
             <li>Trutles breath through their butt</li>
             <li>There’s no place like home. Female marine turtles return to the same nesting grounds where they were born when it’s time for them to lay their own eggs</li>
             <li>Just keep swimming. Male sea turtles spend almost their whole life at sea because, unlike females, they don’t have to return to land to nest.</li>
             <li>Turtle tears. Turtles do cry, but not because they’re sad. They have glands that help to empty excess salt from their eyes, which makes it look like they’re crying.</li>
             </ol>
